# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and
our community a safe, welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate
in our community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in Spoke to help us create safe
and positive experiences for everyone.


## Our Standards

### Open Source Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, we want to know.

### Expected Behavior

* Use welcoming and inclusive language
* Be respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
* Attempt collaboration before conflict.
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism
* Focus on what is best for the community
* Show empathy towards other community members
* Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech, including threats to pursue legal action including litigation
* Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
* Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.

### Unacceptable Behavior

* Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
* Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment, including threats to pursue legal action including litigation
* Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
* Posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission ("doxing").

* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized language, imagery, comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Any community member asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If the member fails to comply immediately, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including [blocking users from collaboration with StateVoices Github repositories](https://help.github.com/en/articles/blocking-a-user-from-your-organization) and/or temporarily banning or permanently expelling the non-complying member from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at codeofconduct@moveon.org. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
