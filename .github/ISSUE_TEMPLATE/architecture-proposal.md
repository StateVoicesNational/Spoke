<!--
RFC stands for "Request for Comment" and is the starting place for a community-wide discussion for new architecture changes, fork reconciliations, or other large scale concerns.

Filling out this issue template allows folks to comment asynchronously, but if the discussion merits more in depth conversation, consider calling a meeting in our slack channel to discuss as a group.

The template leans towards projects that are supported by an organization. We do this to help with the community buy in part of the process since the organizations are the users.

*Which org is backing this plan? If there isn't one yet, do you have one in mind you're in contact with?*
