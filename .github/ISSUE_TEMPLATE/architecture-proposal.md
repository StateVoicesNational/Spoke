RFC stands for "Request for Comment" and is the starting place for a community-wide discussion for new architecture changes, fork reconciliations, or other large scale concerns.

Filling out this issue template allows folks to comment asynchronously, but if the discussion merits more in depth conversation, consider calling a meeting in our slack channel to discuss as a group.
-->

## Proposal:
