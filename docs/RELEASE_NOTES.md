## v5.0
_January 2020:_ Version 5.0
**Note:** This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change. See the deploy steps section for details.

This release includes the following improvements:

- Upgrades react-formal, which gets rid of browser-console warnings related to prop-types
- Fixes a bug for interaction step selection in safari
- Fixes a bug that was causing the people page to not allow you to edit users
- Adds smart color contrasting for the color picker in the campaign creation flow so that you can read the name of your campaign name no matter which color you make it
- Adds an option to allow sharing a single postgres database across multiple Spoke instances, but keep data separate, e.g. using `heroku addons:attach`
- Schema changes paving the way for scaling improvements
- Fixes editing files in emacs by avoiding using unicode
- Allows the Google Script Import feature to be deployed on AWS Lambda

Deploy Steps:

**Instructions for migrating large database instances (>1million messages/contacts)**

1. Make sure SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS=1 in your environment
2. Before deploying the code, you will want to do most of these changes (manually) beforehand, ideally while the system is down. If you are planning to do these migrations before deploying the new code, we strongly recommend merging [this PR separate from the schema changes](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/pull/1346) BEFORE these steps to your production instance. It removes a few bugs which caused postgres to deadlock on message table updates. Instructions below assume Postgres.

2.1 Create the additional columns:

```
ALTER TABLE message ADD COLUMN campaign_contact_id integer NULL REFERENCES campaign_contact(id);
ALTER TABLE message ADD COLUMN messageservice_sid text NULL;
ALTER TABLE message ALTER COLUMN assignment_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

These should be non-blocking and 'quick' -- i.e. downtime is probably unnecessary.

2.2 Once those complete, you will want to create the campaign_contact_id INDEX:

```
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY message_campaign_contact_id_index ON message (campaign_contact_id)
```

The CONCURRENTLY adverb should make this possible without downtime, but sometimes caution is best.

2.3 (LOCKING: Best with system unstressed/down) Next you want to start filling in the campaign_contact_id. You may want to prioritize live or recent campaigns with additional qualifications or do this in batches with a command similar to:

```
UPDATE message
SET campaign_contact_id = campaign_contact.id
FROM campaign_contact
WHERE message.assignment_id = campaign_contact.assignment_id
  AND message.contact_number = campaign_contact.cell
  AND message.id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM message
    WHERE campaign_contact_id IS NULL
    LIMIT 1000000
  )
```

Note the "LIMIT 100000" is doing it in batches of 1 million. Another strategy would be to find the lowest campaign_contact_id value for your live campaigns and add a `WHERE campaign_contact.id > XXX` where XXX is that value (or do the same thing for message.id > XXX).

This WILL LOCK the MESSAGE table -- and thus stop processing of events, so you will want to do this off-hours, ideally with the system down.

Once you have done this with the majority of messages, especially messages for live campaigns, you should now be ready for _real_ downtime.

2.4 (LOCKING: _Requires_ downtime) The final step is to definitely take the system down if you haven't already. Complete updates to messageservice_sid and campaign_contact_id, there are some final steps:

```
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cell_messageservice_sid_idx ON message (contact_number, messageservice_sid);
DROP INDEX message_contact_number_index;
INSERT INTO knex_migrations (name, batch, migration_time) VALUES
  ( '20191217125726_add_message_campaign_contact_id.js', 3, now()),
  ( '20191217130355_change_message_indexes.js', 3, now()),
  ('20191217130000_message_migrate_data.js', 3, now());
```

2.5 Deploy the new code!
2.6 As soon as possible (after system is working) then run:

```
DROP INDEX message_assignment_id_index;
```

NOTES:

- One of the main challenges besides migrating and indexing a large table is that many indexes on the `message` table with so many inserts, can tax the insertions too much and slow the system down. So, while we are indexing both assignment_id AND contact_number AND contact_number+messageservice_sid AND campaign_contact_id, the system is likely to be over stressed. This is why we stagger the index creation and then drop the unnecessary indexes as soon as we have the system up again. Obviously if ALL these steps are done during a single downtime, event, then that would work too -- but staggering them can allow shorter and stepped periods of downtime or migration.

## v4.1

_January 2019:_ Version 4.1

This release includes the following improvements:

- Fixes twilio bugs for incoming text spam and message duplicate tests
- Fixes bug in which Spoke was not scrubbing opt outs from larger organizations

Thanks to @schuyler1d and @strangeways for these critical fixes. This patch will be required in order to successfully update to v5.0

## v4.0

_December 2019:_ Version 4.0
**Note:** This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change. See the deploy steps section for details.

This release includes the following improvements:

- Adds better error logging to Spoke allowing visibility into errors that twilio and other messaging services are sending rather than them getting "lost"
- Fixes bulk send, which is used outside the USA to send more than one initial message with a single button click making it usable again!
- Multiple documentation fixes including better documentation on how to run the test suite
- Adds 2 React component tests
- Fixes bugs that wouldn't let you exit out of adding a new script, that made reassigning contacts often not work, that would often cause the skip reply button not to appear
- Updates the google-libphonenumber library to allow phone numbers using newer area codes (e.g. 463) to be validated.

Deploy Steps:

- Warning: This migration removes the `message.service_response` column which tracks responses to/from the Twilio API.
  This data is not needed for the application to function, but e.g. some users have queried it to keep the MediaUrl values
  (i.e. images sent to the texter, even though they aren't displayed). After the migration, they will still be queryable for
  new texts (only POST-migration texts) in the `log` table. If you're not sure, then before deploying, make sure you backup
  the `message` table--at least the `message.service_response` column.
- For the speediest migration, we recommend DELETING all past log rows with `TRUNCATE TABLE LOG`.
  Before doing so, consider backing up the `log` table -- though no data there is needed for running the application (and it takes up considerable space).
- For smaller instances (less than 1 million texts/contacts), the migration should complete automatically.
- For larger instances, it's better to enable the environment variable `SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS=1`
  and then follow the relevant steps of your platform to upgrade ( [Heroku](./HOWTO_HEROKU_DEPLOY.md#migrating-the-database), [AWS Lambda](./DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database) )

## v2.0

_April 2019:_ Version 2.0.0

This release includes an improvement to message sending speeds, many usability improvements to the Admin Message Review panel, bug fixes for different features, improved data warehouse querying for audiences, Docker support/documentation, Local Authentication, etc. We also have switched to using `yarn` dev and install commands versus `npm`. To see an updated feature list, please visit opensource.moveon.org/spoke.

Migrations:

- Texting hour related columns to the `Campaign` table.
- Send_before column to the `Message` table.
- Creator_id column to the `Campaign` table.

Heroku:

The Heroku deployment method has been migrated to the container runtime. When upgrading an existing Heroku app, these [migration steps](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/33e2edcc455836f36eafd56d585430ac1ceda515/docs/HOWTO_HEROKU_DEPLOY.md#upgrading-an-existing-heroku-app) will need to be performed.

Lambda:

This version includes an update for the Node runtime environment. For current AWS Lambda Users - you can update your Node runtime to 8.10 by either visiting the `Function code` Section and moving the drop down to 8.10 or by running the following script: `claudia update --runtime nodejs8.10`. For new Lambda deployments, Claudia.js will default to Node 8.10.

## v1.4.1

_August 2018:_ Version 1.4.1

- This version fixes bugs found in 1.4 including a deployment bug.

## v1.4

This release includes many optimizations, new features and more tests! We've fixed outstanding bugs, added more administrative functionality and worked on the texter experience. We've also introduced a new testing suite and redis caching capabilities. Over the next couple months, we intend to add more testing and continue to work on scaling.

Note - we will have a new release in the next few weeks and switch to a shorter release cycle in the next few months. Please upgrade your instance and let us know if you find any bugs or have questions!

_July 2018:_ Version 1.4

- A 'Skipped Messages' section for texters to allow access to previously skipped conversations. Skipped conversations can be 'reopened' and filter back into the 'replies' view.
- A 'Message Review' board for administrators to allow message reassignment to different texters. Administrators also have the ability to see more incoming messages than previous.
- The ability to mark contacts as opted out without sending a message.
- Selenium end to end testing with Sauce Labs integration.
- Redis caching capabilities including caching user's authentication status.
- Updates to documentation for AK integration, popular queries, and email and data exporting integration.
- Bug fixes around owner, admin and superadmin permissions when attempting to text, timezone handling, permission issues on admin dashboard.
- Update to our community guidelines.

## v1.3

Two major themes that we are focusing on this year are improving
integrations and scaling. This release begins that work with support
for MailGun notifications and Revere subscriptions. In order to scale
work-flows, we have added a new SuperVolunteer position and now allow
texters to update their own information.

Over the next couple months, we intend to integrate with more outside
systems and we will also be adding significant work
around scaling the system to support much larger volumes and participants.
We will also be continuing to add more automated tests to scale participation.
All of that is to make sure that the growing community can keep adding
enhancements yourself -- please jump in on our issues page to either
implement something or file an issue on something you want Spoke to do!

Please upgrade your instance and let us know if you encounter any issues!

_April 2018:_ Version 1.3

- A 'Past Messages' section for Texters to allow access to previous conversations before a reply comes back.
  This feature helps cases where someone accidentally clicked a button or wants to follow-up with requested information.
- Texters can update their name, email and other information from the menu.
  Admins can update texter info from the console
- A new SuperVolunteer role, which allows a non-admin to update assignments, and [some other tasks](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues/455)
- Added [MailGun support](HOWTO_HEROKU_DEPLOY.md#setting-up-mailgun)
- Frontend React tests!
- Added an action handler to automatically subscribe to a [Revere](https://reverehq.com/)
  SMS list -- see [Revere integration instructions](HOWTO_INTEGRATE_WITH_REVERE.md)
- Fixed some bugs:
  - The texter menu now has a home button
  - The zipcode table was too big to fit in a free Heroku database
  - Some login issues were fixed and documentation was improved
  - Improved contact load times for texter screen

## v1.2

_January 2018:_ Version 1.2 is our second release since MoveOn has adopted Spoke. We are committed to fixing bugs, adding new features and making this project as nimble as possible. For this release, we've included changes from [GetUp](https://www.getup.org.au/), updated certain dependencies, updated Auth0 integration, added user editing capabilities for texters and admins and continued to add outside integration points with outside CRMs. Please continue to add and work on our growing [issues list](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues). We have also switched from `master` => `main` as a new naming convention for the most stable/default branch.

We've worked on a lot, but some critical developments to highlight include:

- Adds dynamic assignment functionality for texters
- Adds user editing capabilities for texters and administrators
- Adds support for customized styling for campaigns
- Adds ActionKit integration for event sign up and documentation
- Adds support for multi-media images in outgoing texts (mms)
- Adds support for campaign script editing on live campaigns
- Moved to Prop-Types library, upgraded Webpack and other development dependencies
- Adds Code Climate test integration to monitor test coverage
- Adds opt out count for a campaign to admin dashboard stats

## v1.1

_October 2017:_ Version 1.1 is our first release since MoveOn has been using Spoke successfully in production. We are committed to
making this an open-source project used and developed by the wider progressive tech community to advance our
political goals. Part of our work has been to make that transparent. Besides this public repository, please help
with our growing [issues list](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues), including those marked `easy`.

But of course, we've also done some actual development work! We've fixed a ton of bugs, but here are some
highlights for this release:

- Adds a passing test framework
- Resolves many bugs related to saving and updating a Campaign for admins
- Improves the Texter interface (better reply visibility, especially on mobile) along with sending on `<Enter>`
- Adds a [Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke#deploy-to-heroku) button for easier first-time deployments
- Documented [how to deploy on Amazon AWS Lambda](DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md)
- Migrated from a RethinkDB backend to a Knex.js backend (we recommend use with postgresql database)
- Improved Spoke's security
