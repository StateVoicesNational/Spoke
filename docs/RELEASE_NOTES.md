# Release Notes

## v9.2

_September 2020:_ Version 9.2

### Spoke Project Status Update

As we are getting closer to the 2020 election, MoveOn is 'code-freezing' changes on our production instance.
We believe campaigns and Spoke hosters would be well-advised to do the same and aim for stability over this time.
The only releases before November 3rd, 2020 will be for security updates.

We will also continue to merge additions to documentation and integration test PRs directly into our `main` branch.

That said, other hosters and developers are continuing to make bug fixes and add important features for their
own texting programs.  Normally, MoveOn's release process involves first gathering a release candidate, then
running QA on the changes, and finally running it in production for a day or two to shake out any bugs missed
during QA and review and to evaluate the release 'at scale'.  Without this final step, we can't make a strong commitment
to release readiness.

However, we want to track these improvements, so we will be maintaining two 'experimental' PRs -- one more conservative
with small changes and mostly bug fixes: [stage-main-postelection2020-stable](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/pull/1830).
The other with larger changes but riskier to deploy before the election: [stage-main-postelection2020-unstable](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/pull/1831).  If a hosting partner steps up to
run one of these at any time and affirms its stability, we will mark that.  Additionally, in the conservative PR,
we will link to specific PRs that if you run into a particular bug in production you can cherry-pick that PR to fix that issue.

After the election, I'm sure there will be a lot of changes and diverged branches from different organizations.
We will be here to try to gather those changes, but we'd like to note that will be significant work and can't happen
without those organizations also making an effort to separate their 'hacks' to make something work vs. changes that
will be maintainable and support the long-term architecture and stability of Spoke for the community.  We recommend
whenever possible, opening a PR on specific small changes -- these are more likely to be mergeable after the election.
If that's not possible due to time/development constraints, we ask that you at least open a 'organization dev' PR that
just includes all your changes -- then post-election we can at least sort out the features and the community can
have a place to see what was done.

I'd like to take a moment to celebrate this amazing community -- so many progressive orgs and campaigns are using Spoke and
contributing back to it -- along with a cadre of committed volunteer developers, designers and texters.  Good luck
with all your campaigns -- let's win!

### New Features/Improvements

- Throughout the admin on the People page, Message Review, and Campaign stats, there are little links to the texter's
  own Todos page view. This can be useful for admins to see what campaigns a texter is part of and debug any
  issues where seeing the texter view can help.
- Experimental DB_READONLY_HOST variable which can connect to a replica/read-only instance for some specific queries.
  In the event of high database stress, setting this may help relieve IO on the 'writer' database instance.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a regression in 9.1 where /twilio-message-report Twilio validation would fail if TWILIO_MULTI_ORG=1 but
  TWILIO_MESSAGE_CALLBACK_URL was NOT set.  We reverted that behavior, but recommend that you update your
  twilio config to `/twilio-message-report/<org id>` in this configuration and then set TWILIO_VALIDATION=1
- Fixed a but in 9.1 on the superadmin organizations page where creating an organization did not work.
- Fixed two minor security issues to restrict post-login redirect and hide errors on the front-end by-default.
  If you want to re-enable errors on the front-end, set SHOW_SERVER_ERROR=1
- Fixed issue with Release Contacts texter sidebox where clicking "Done for the day" would not give feedback on
  the todos screen -- it now clears the 'send first messages' and 'replies' buttons where appropriate.

Thanks to [jeffm2001](https://github.com/jeffm2001) and [schuyler1d](https://github/schuyler1d)

## v9.1

_September 2020:_ Version 9.1

* Regression notice: When TWILIO_MULTI_ORG=1 is set but TWILIO_MESSAGE_CALLBACK_URL is not, /twilio-message-report
  fails.  There is a [fix](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/pull/1826) that is also available in 9.2 (above).

### New Features/Improvements
- **New UI for adding organizations to your instance:** There is now a page only accessible for users with `is_superadmin` set for adding orgs in a Spoke instance. You can access this screen through the user menu under "superadmin tools." We've gated this feature to only users with that privilege to keep any roles you already have on your instances from suddenly gaining the ability to add orgs. You can only change a user's `is_superadmin` status with a direct DB query at this time. *The first user on new instances will be a superadmin by default now*
- **Past campaign contact loader:** Creates a contact loader that allows someone to select contacts from a past campaign and filter optionally for a particular question response (or no response) by entering a message review query into the contact loader. The contact loader has instructions inline.
- **ActionNetwork action handler:** syncs TAGS and EVENT RSVPs back to ActionNetwork when linked to a question answer in an interaction script.
- **Two new custom fields to track contact by id:** We're including `contactId` and `contactIdBase62` as custom fields to help with use cases around tracking link clicks. At MoveOn we have been using these fields as url params in our scripts for our data exports -- e.g. Hi will you rsvp to an event at someeventlink.com/source={contactIdBase62} the base62 variant is to keep the size of the text messages down.
- **Downtime configuration:** new env vars `DOWNTIME` and `DOWNTIME_NO_DB` ([see reference](REFERENCE-environment_variables.md)) put Spoke in a downtime state that renders a downtime page to serve as a "kill switch" if there are problems with an instance. This is a useful tool for dealing with bugs, scaling issues or deployments that require manual intervention.
- **Sqs batching and dispatchProcesses improvements:** improvements to the SQS functionality in Spoke to help set up AWS SQS queueing. Check out this [Twilio blog post for more information](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/07/handling-high-volume-inbound-sms-and-webhooks-with-twilio-functions-and-amazon-sqs.html).
- **Add importing of response tags to google docs import:** You can now use italics to include tags your google script import templating. Check the default template in the [Google script import doc](HOWTO_IMPORT_GOOGLE_DOCS_SCRIPTS_TO_IMPORT.md) for details.
- "Convos" and "Stats" buttons on the campaign edit page for live campaigns: The "stats" button will take you to the campaign stats page, the "convos" button will take you to message review pre-filtered to only show messages from that campaign. These changes make it easier to navigate back and forth between Campaign Edit/Stats pages.
- Job to update optouts regularly: In case the update fails or in the case of autoupdates where it does not update by default you can get this job running to keep opt outs staying updated. For more information on how to run jobs in your build, check the Heroku (worker dynos), AWS (cron jobs) or your infra of choices's docs on running jobs.
- To reduce the information sent to the texter, we filter out fields that aren't used in scripts or canned responses.
- Speed up deduplication query

### Bug Fixes
- Allow admins and supervols to see organization settings
- fixes allContactsCount: it should not always be 1
- datawarehouse contact-loaders fixes

## v9.0

_August 2020:_ Version 9.0

This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change. This is a minor schema change, which you can run before/during migration (either by leaving/disabling SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS="" or for [AWS Lambda, see the db migration instructions](HOWTO_DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database)

We just (stealth) released 8.1 -- why the quick second release? Well, we deployed 8.1 at MoveOn on production and it was doing great for two days. On the third day there was a final set of tweaks and thus we cut the release for 8.1 on Wednesday 8/26. Well, Murphy's law -- two hours after we finished up the release we started hitting production issues. We have not yet scaled up for our "hockeystick" (where the participation graph looks like a hockey stick and surges) period and to prepare @schuyler1d asked the campaigners to "try to break Spoke this week." The team sent 1 million messages with 70K sent in a 5 minute period and our database started failing.

We will be upgrading this weekend and the great thing about Spoke is it scales "linearly" -- if you double the resources, then you can roughly double the contacts/texters-per-day metrics.

But because of the timing it was ambiguous whether we 'just' hit scaling issues yesterday or whether there were bugs in Spoke 8.1. @schuyler1d spent the day tracking everything that went wrong and determined that it was scaling. This prompted some urgent improvements to make our queries more efficient with increased focus on more improvements so the application can do its part in keeping scaling costs as low as possible. But these last set are pretty impactful -- even without upgrading our system with almost the same texting volume as yesterday we are seeing *half the database load.*

### 9.0 Changes

- Schema change on the opt_out table (please see instructions for migrating)
- Drastically improves the query efficiency for the Texter Todos page
- Removes some liability of thrashing with auto-optout updating.

### 8.1 Highlights
8.1 still makes up the bulk of 9.0's featureset, so here's what to look out for and check out the [8.1 section](RELEASE_NOTES.md#v81) for the full list of awesome changes

- **Tagging:** The tags feature is no longer experimental! This release includes a few adjustments to tags that finish the tagging story:
  - **Resolve tags:** tags can now be resolved in message review by clicking the 'x' in their upper right corner.
  - **Canned response tagging:** you can apply 1 or more tags to a canned response which will automatically apply that tags when a texter uses that canned response.
- **Addressable message review queries:** message review now has "addressable urls" meaning that the url is changed whenever you make a query. This now allows you to directly link to a specific query. Because of this, there are now links in the texter stats section of the campaign page that link to a filter for that specific texter and a new "convos" button that takes you directly to a view that filters down to only messages within the campaign.
- **Allow search terms to be _excluded_ from the campaign search:**  If a search starts with "-", it filters out campaigns that match the rest of the search term.
- **Documentation microsite:** our docs now exist on an [external microsite](https://moveonorg.github.io/Spoke) to help our docs
- [Documentation now exists for all of the extensions!](HOWTO-extend-spoke.md)

### Appreciations
Thanks for quick and impactful work from [schuyler1d](https://github.com/schuyler1d) to get 8.1 to a better more stable 9.0! Thank you so much to the **11** community contributors that made all the features and bug fixes possible: [inorvig](https://github.com/inorvig), [oburbank](https://github.com/oburbank), [aschneit](https://github.com/aschneit), [jeffm2001](https://github.com/jeffm2001), [lperson](https://github.com/lperson), [ibrand](https://github.com/ibrand), [bdatkins](https://github.com/bdatkins), [JeremyParker](https://github.com/JeremyParker), [tekkamanendless ](https://github.com/tekkamanendless), [sharonsolomon](https://github.com/sharonsolomon), [nke5ka](https://github.com/nke5ka)

## v8.1

_August 2020:_ Version 8.1

**Note: we highly recommend upgrading to v9.0 if you're on v8.1 since 9.0 helps a lot with election time scaling**

### New Features/Improvements
- **Tagging:** The tags feature is no longer experimental! This release includes a few adjustments to tags that finish the tagging story:
  - **Resolve tags:** tags can now be resolved in message review by clicking the 'x' in their upper right corner.
  - **Canned response tagging:** you can apply 1 or more tags to a canned response which will automatically apply that tags when a texter uses that canned response.
- **Remove the Opt Outs sidebar menu:** this menu did not scale well and wasn't being used by many orgs. All it did was print a long list of all of the phone numbers that had opted out across the organization. You can easily query the database to get that same list of numbers.
- **Addressable message review queries:** message review now has "addressable urls" meaning that the url is changed whenever you make a query. This now allows you to directly link to a specific query. Because of this, there are now links in the texter stats section of the campaign page that link to a filter for that specific texter and a new "convos" button that takes you directly to a view that filters down to only messages within the campaign.
- UI button in the settings page for clearing the organization and extension cache. If an admin uses a SQL client to modify `organization.features` or metadata changes in an external resource, such as NGP VAN (the use cases in VAN is that a saved list was added or survey questions or activists code were modified; Spoke's VAN integration won't go back to VAN through the API if those metadata are present in the cache)
- Allow search terms to be _excluded_ from the campaign search.  If a search starts with "-", it filters out campaigns that match the rest of the search term.
- Foundation for a documentation microsite to help our docs stay readable and accessible to devs and admin
- New [Freshworks Freshdesk](https://freshdesk.com/) texter-sidebox for anyone using Freshdesk as a help hub for texters! Enable it by adding `freshworks-widget` to the texter-sideboxes env var list
- Add support for Twilio error 21408 which happens when you try to send a message to a phone
number outside of your "Geo-Permissions" settings
- More clarity to the Redis docs
- Receive Twilio messages from behind a proxy using TWILIO_MESSAGE_CALLBACK_URL
- Dynamic Assignment Batch strategy can be chosen per-campaign
- You can now search for error codes in message review!
- [Documentation now exists for all of the extensions!](HOWTO-extend-spoke.md)

### Bug Fixes
- Copy all relevant campaign properties when copying a campaign (the whole campaign is now copied over and the interaction steps are copied in the right order)
- Show a pop up when the copy campaign button is clicked to let you know it was copied
- fix message sending where additional context info needs to be sent for service.sendMessage than previously -- e.g. for TWILIO auth, etc
- Small phone inventory improvements
- Small message aesthetic touch ups
- Remove the scrollbars in every cell in the admin and people pages
- Ensure that interactions are copied deterministically

## v8.0

_August 2020:_ Version 8.0
**Note: Dynamic assignment is changing!** Pay special attention to the write up. This new and improved dynamic assignment should make the dynamic assignment flow friendlier to coaching new texters, and assist the reassignment flow.

This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change which you can run before/during migration (either by leaving/disabling SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS="" or for [AWS Lambda, see the db migration instructions](DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database). Anything marked as experimental has not yet been tested on a production texting campaign. We're marking this as a major version update 8.0 because there are several backwards-incompatible changes that we believe are important and valuable.

### Backwards incompatible Changes
- **Dynamic Assignment is changing**: After a lot of feedback and some great inspiration from the [Warren Spoke](https://github.com/Elizabeth-Warren/Spoke) we're modifying dynamic assign. Texters will now request batch sizes instead of getting an endless stream of texts. The admin can customize the batch size and who is allowed to click request after their first batch. There is more documentation on this feature [here](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/main/docs/HOWTO-use-dynamicassignment-batches.md).This feature is also optionally complemented by the new "release texts" feature which is mentioned under "New Features/Improvements"
- **Old Texter UI is _no longer supported_**: We removed the `DEPRECATED_TEXTERUI` env variable and the old Texter UI is officially phased out
- **Texter Sideboxes are now off by default**: You now need to enable options in organization Settings tab (they previously were just automatically enabled from the variable)
  - If your previously set TEXTER_SIDEBOXES, then you must add `default-dynamicassignment` (and we recommend adding other new ones listed in new features) for dynamic assignment to work. 
  - If you are not using additional/experimental sideboxes, we recommend removing this environment variable entirely, so new texter sideboxes in later versions will automatically be available.
  - HOLD_ENTER_KEY no longer exists as an option (it was deprecated in our last major version)
- For non-US or subscriber-only mode users ONLY -- if you enabled ALLOW_SEND_ALL=1 (if you did not, then DO not do this), then you'll need to check to enable that feature in the Settings panel of your organization (as a is_superadmin user)
- Initial text messages are editable -- we recommend allowing the (default) TEXTER_SIDEBOXES= to include `default-editinitial` to make this option more muted.
- the src/integrations/ directory is renamed src/extensions/ to indicate that it's not just integrations with 3rd parties but also components that extend the system itself (message-handlers, texter-sideboxes, dynamicassignment-batches, job-runners). If you added your own src/integrations/ items make sure they are moved, and relevant imports are changed.
- There is a small migration to the `campaign` table which needs to be run before/during migration (either by leaving/disabling SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS="" or for [AWS Lambda, see the db migration instructions](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database)

### New Features/Improvements
- Use of Spoke is subject to legal restrictions which each organization should review and understand, including recent guidance from an FCC ruling. Spoke 8.0 has several changes related to this guidance and we recommend system administrators review the settings outlined [here](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/main/docs/REFERENCE-best-practices-conformance-messaging.md) along with consulting your own legal advice.
- **_Experimental_ Phone number management for campaigns**: A much requested feature for scaling past the 400 phone numbers limit.
  - turn this on with `EXPERIMENTAL_CAMPAIGN_NUMBERS`
- **_Experimental_ Release Texts**: Dynamic Assignment will also include a way for texters to release texts! That way when a texter is done for the day they can release texts without admin needing to go in and reassign them.
  - Toggle this on and off in the organization settings menu
- **texter-sidebox extension improvements**: (SummaryComponent, Empty context)
- **new message-handler `to-ascii`**: converts smart quotes and special dash characters to ascii. That way unicode wont surprisingly enlarge the message size.
- VAN action handler improvements
- Allow for action handlers to be included in google doc imports
- Better docs for developer onboarding
- Ctrl-z and Ctrl-Enter to Send (and any letter key/Enter sends on initial texting page)
- For phone number purchase interface, entering "800" will buy toll-free numbers (instead of by-areacode)
- Admins can visit app/:organizationId/todos/other/:userId to look at another user's todos page.
- Additional organization settings available from the Settings section (If you have an existing instance, enable this with OWNER_CONFIGURABLE=ALL
- Phone number buying and Twilio multi org enabled by default for new installs -- 
- Phone number buying can purchase toll-free numbers with "800"
- Campaign "response window" defaults to 48 hours and can be changed per campaign and then queries in Message Review to find who hasn't responded past the window.  A default can be set in Organization Settings page (overriding defaults)

### Bug Fixes
- Fix VAN action handler with warehouse loader
- Block blank message sending
- Fixes needsResponseCount out of sync with optouts (auto and no message)
- fix GSScriptEditor for Safari browsers that auto-focus

### Appreciations

Thanks to [jasterix](https://github.com/jasterix), [ibrand](https://github.com/ibrand), [jeffm2001](https://github.com/jeffm2001), [lperson](https://github.com/lperson), [matteosb](https://github.com/matteosb), [tekkamanendless ](https://github.com/tekkamanendless), and [schuyler1d](https://github.com/schuyler1d)

## v7.1

_July 2020:_ Release 7.1 is a testament to the community working together -- several organizations using Spoke contributed features along with several open-source progressive volunteers (several as their first contribution)!  Thank you to all who contributed.  At the top in "Significant for deployments" there are top-lines for what to know before or during upgrade.  As usual, please let us know if you have any issues.

### Significant for deployments:

* After changing the texter send keyboard shortcut to Ctrl-X we have moved it (again) to Ctrl-Enter (to avoid conflict with OS 'cut' shortcuts)
* There is a small migration to the user table which needs to be run before/during migration (either by leaving/disabling SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS="" or for [AWS Lambda, see the db migration instructions](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database)
* If you are running on lambda, you might consider setting JOB_RUNNER="lambda-async" for better scaling/performance

### New Features
* Suspending texters: marking a texter Suspended in the People page immediately stops them from being able to text - @JeremyParker
* Zapier action handler support for triggering when contact tags are updated - @lperson (enable with adding `zapier-action` in your ACTION_HANDLERS env var)
* Extra Profile Fields -- by setting an organization features variable in the database, additional profile fields can be added during signup, which can be required even for existing users to complete. - @jeffm2001
* [Slack Authentication](./HOWTO_INTEGRATE_SLACK_AUTH.md) (alternative to Auth0 or local)  - @matteosb
* Tag data in campaign export files - @jeffm2001
* DataWarehouse contact loader bugfixes (actually works now) - @jeffm2001
* Edit canned responses (you used to just be able to add/remove -- now you can edit) - @aschneit
* Reduced 'flash' while sending initial text messages -- now the Send button just blinks instead of the whole screen for reduced visual strain - @eamouzou
* Character and segment counts in the Script Editor - @hiemanshu
* Timezone sorting on the Campaign Admin List - @alliejones
* "Needs Response" count on Campaign Admin List, when [Redis is configured](./HOWTO_CONNECT_WITH_REDIS.md) - @schuyler1d
* Improved NGP VAN cell selection from lists - @lperson
* More experimental message-handler extensions: "auto-optout" allows automatic optout based on certain text coming in from a contact. and "profanity-tagger" gains an option to block a message on-send based on content. - @schuyler1d
* An exciting new "dispatch" framework to send jobs and tasks asynchronously for tracking which can differ by framework -- especially supporting AWS Lambda, but there is also an experimental "bull" implementation using Redis that we may want to default on Heroku deployments.  Please tell us of your experience here.  This should resolve a large number of bugs and improve performance in many places. - @matteosb
* Documenting Progressive Hacknight - @ibrand

### Bugs fixed
* weird [Object object] when tabbing into canned response text issue - @eamouzou
* simplified docker-compose file - @matteosb
* fix action handler select menu in Campaign Admin Interactions section - @matteosb

### Appreciations

Thanks to [alliejones](https://github.com/alliejones), [aschneit](https://github.com/aschneit), [eamouzou](https://github.com/eamouzou), [hiemanshu](https://github.com/hiemanshu), [ibrand](https://github.com/ibrand), [jeffm2001](https://github.com/jeffm2001), [JeremyParker](https://github.com/JeremyParker), [lperson](https://github.com/lperson), [matteosb](https://github.com/matteosb), and [schuyler1d](https://github.com/schuyler1d).

Also to AFL-CIO, MoveOn, NYCET, Scale to Win, and Working Families Party for sending their contributions and giving early feedback/debugging time.

### Coming up

In our next release, we're hoping to have even more VAN support in message handlers, some timezone config flexibility, some changes and features related to the recent FCC court decision, and hopefully a new dynamic assignment model. -- of course, along with a whole lot more -- send us your changes now, so we can bring it in to the next version!


## v7.0
_June 2020:_ Version 7.0 (or 6.19 in honor of Juneteenth!)
**Note:** This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change. See the deploy steps section for details. Anything marked as *experimental* has not yet been tested on a production texting campaign.
We're marking this as a major version update: 7.0 because there are several backwards-incompatible changes that we believe are important and valuable.

### Backwards incompatibilities:

* This change has schema changes on the `campaign` table which you should make sure to update -- it should be a fast and painless upgrade (automatic if you have it setup). See the deploy steps section for details of how to migrate.
* There are many Texter UI accessibility improvements, but they do come at the expense of changing how the Enter key behaves for texters.  You should communicate this to your texting team and update and training materials. (to revert this functionality, you can enable the env var HOLD_ENTER_KEY=1)
* SuperVolunteer roles now have access to all MessageReview operations.

### Improvements

* There is now further support for VAN -- a robust action handler that can be enabled by adding `ACTION_HANDLERS=ngpvan-action` to your environment variables will enable this.
* We have a new framework for extending the Texter UI interface called ["sideboxes"](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues/1533).  Enabled with environment variable TEXTER_SIDEBOXES which works similarly to action handlers, where it should be a comma separated list of enabled sideboxes. Developers can add sidebox functionality, and admins can set defaults in the organization Settings section and changes per-campaign -- enabling/disabling sideboxes.  Two so-far are:
  * `contact-reference` which is a link the texter can click and/or share with an admin for direct access to that conversation later
  * `tag-contact` which if you have EXPERIMENTAL_TAGS=1 enabled and create tags, a texter will have an interface to mark them.  They can then be filtered for in Message Review.

  There will be more work here going forward -- feedback is welcome as this is still a feature in active development.

* There is _another_ new experimental framework: Message Handlers which can intercept a message pre and post-save with a sample message handler that can tag profanity -- you can experiment with this by setting `MESSAGE_HANDLERS=profanity-tagger`
* Texter UI Accessibility improvements -- previously we captured the Enter key to send a message. This was inaccessible because the Enter key is used when navigating with the keyboard in order to 'click' a button. Sending is now possible with `Ctrl-x` (and skip is `Ctrl-y`).
* We have now disabled by default the ability to hold down the Enter key -- for sending you can now press any letter key (or Enter) to send a message. If you want this functionality back set HOLD_ENTER_KEY=1
* There is now a campaign 'sending errors' report which summarizes how many sending errors have been reported by Twilio.  Carrier Violation error messages are especially useful (and important) to track.
* A new contact-loader that allows upload into S3 to make larger uploads possible if you have deployed on AWS.
* A new environment or organization.features variable MAX_TEXTERS_PER_CAMPAIGN which can block more texters from joining a campaign with dynamic assignment.

### Bug fixes

There are too many bug fixes to mention -- [please see the full list of linked changes](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/pull/1623)

### Deploy Steps:
Instructions for migrating you database

* Make sure SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS="" (not 0!) in your environment
* If you're using AWS Lambda, check out the [deploy instructions here](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/main/docs/DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database)

### Appreciations!

Thanks to all the contributors part of this release including: @ibrand @lperson @matteosb @schuyler1d

Also special shout outs to [Working Families Party](https://workingfamilies.org/) and [Movement For Black Lives](https://m4bl.org/) for staging some of these changes and giving feedback (along with MoveOn, too) -- Thank you to the Spoke teams there that drove great campaigns while providing technical bug reports so we could make this a better release :heart:

### Onward

Our next release, we're expecting some more great features -- ability to suspend texters, improving the dynamic assignment workflow, and more improvements around tags.  Devs and orgs, please send your PRs in now, so we can test your work out and get it in the next release.


## v6.1
_June 2020:_ Version 6.1

6.1 is mostly focused on technical improvements. We upgraded to the 2.x versions of apollo-client and react-apollo and removed the dependency on redux. This allowed us to fix some long-standing bugs and should improve the developer experience for Spoke contributors.

**Improvements**
* Data loading errors are displayed to the user rather than causing blank screens or infinite loading animations
* Enhanced the action handler framework with better error handling and caching to improve performance, and added the ability for administrators to optionally select extra information on a per-question-response basis to be sent to the remote system when a texter selects the response.

**Changes**
* Removed the threeClickEnabled organization feature

**Bug fixes**
* Resolved numerous issues related to cache collisions in the Apollo store
* Job progress updates more reliably on the campaign creation screen
* Fixed select all on the campaign archive screen
* Closing the user edit modal now takes you back to the person list
* Fixed an issue that allowed campaigns to start before all jobs completed

## v6.0
_May 2020:_ Version 6.0
**Note:** This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change. See the deploy steps section for details. Anything marked as *experimental* has not yet been tested on a production texting campaign.
We're marking this as a major version update: 6.0 because there are several backwards-incompatible changes that we think you will love:

- *Experimental* Phone number inventory management -- Adds functionality to buy Twilio phone numbers directly through the Admin interface. Organizations using their own Messaging Service, i.e. those that have TWILIO_MESSAGE_SERVICE set in organization features rather than through the global env var, can add the numbers directly to their Messaging Service and use them for texting. Additionally, phone numbers purchased through Spoke can be configured to use a custom voice response by setting the TWILIO_VOICE_URL setting. A typical use case would be to use TwiML Bins to re-route calls or to play a custom voicemails. To configure:
  - Set EXPERIMENTAL_PHONE_INVENTORY to enable the feature
  - Set TWILIO_VOICE_URL for a custom voice response
- *Experimental* Per-campaign Twilio Messaging Services -- This feature lays the foundation for scaling Spoke on Twilio by allowing campaigns to use their own Messaging Services. When enabled, the campaign edit screen will allow admins to either supply a Messaging Service for the campaign to use or to have Spoke create one for them. Note that numbers will have to be added to the Messaging Service manually. This feature will be integrated with the phone number inventory in a future release. To configure:
  - Set EXPERIMENTAL_TWILIO_PER_CAMPAIGN_MESSAGING_SERVICE to enable
  - Set TWILIO_BASE_CALLBACK_URL to configure webhooks for Messaging Services created by Spoke. Required if this feature is enabled.
- New Texting UI -- in version 5.6 it was enableable with EXPERIMENTAL_TEXTERUI ahead of time. It is now the default! For this version, we allow you to preserve the old texter UI by setting the environment variable DEPRECATED_TEXTERUI=GONE_SOON. Also note that with the new UI we have removed user-created Canned Responses -- there's consensus that it causes more problems than it helps. We've also long had the Super Volunteer role which most campaigns use for a group of texters that can update canned responses when needed.
  - As part of this Texter UI, you can create [shortcut buttons](./REFERENCE-shortcut-rules.md) that will surface some of your question responses and canned responses as a row of buttons outside of a menu to speed up a texter's response flow. [Check out the docs to learn more!](./REFERENCE-shortcut-rules.md)
- Action Handler developers: Through the great work of @lperson for improved VAN support, our action handler api used to return a true/false value for the available() call -- it should now return an object with two keys: { result: <boolean on available>, expiresSeconds: <how long to cache the result, 0 by default>}
There are several schema changes -- only adding fields, so migration should be easy/fast. However, if you have SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS enabled, then you will need to manually migrate the database ( Heroku, AWS Lambda )

In addition to those changes, we've improved the Admin People page (@lperson ) and made some tweaks to the Campaign Edit page (@matteosb , @higgyCodes ), and the Texter Todo list (@larkinds ).

Deploy Steps:

**Instructions for migrating you database**

1. Make sure SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS="" (not 0!) in your environment
2. If you're using AWS Lambda, check out the [deploy instructions here](DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database)

## v5.5
_May 2020:_ Version 5.5
- Campaign List Admin changes (@lperson, @schuyler1d)
- Twilio Auth per organization (@jeffm2001 ) -- Now if you enable TWILIO_MULTI_ORG environment variable, each organization can use a different Twilio account that they can setup in the Settings Admin tab. This also allows per-organization message services. There is more work coming to allow [message services per-campaign](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues/1495) and [in-app phone number management](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues/1518)
- This release has several developing features -- you might say it's a 'preview' release of things to come. You can turn on these features with environment variables
  - EXPERIMENTAL_TEXTERUI: After some amazing design work by @arena with multiple iterations and two user testing rounds by @ibrand, We are planning to make this the DEFAULT texter interface in the next Spoke release. We know that this has some challenges for current deployments -- updating documentation and training materials for texters. Just like you switch ON this new version in this release, for one release (and no more), we intend that you will be able to set a different environment variable in order to keep the old interface. That should allow you to control the switch to the new interface gracefully.
    - We put a lot of work into this interface to accomodate upcoming features, radically improve the mobile (and generally cross-screen support) and address some issues that regularly come up for texters.
    - Please send your experience reports in testing
    - More context can be seen at [RFC: New Texter UI](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/pull/1522)
  - EXPERIMENTAL_TAGS: Tagging users instead of just saving question responses is a very common request, and we have a great volunteer team developing these features. This first step is creating an admin interface to create the tags. There will be more to come, but you can preview and test this development by enabling the environment variable. Thanks to @aschneit and @filafb!

- Scaling improvements
- Add organization as an argument to getConfig so config can come from `organization.features` json column OR global context
- Refactor AssignmentTexterContact to create new demo screens for the texter UI in prep for a texter UI redesign and to help with training
- Reduces memory and write pressure in the database through removing superfluous indexes from campaign-contact
- Adds functionality to the Contact Loaders ingest framework for persistence and some api/integration use-cases
- New component tests
- Server change to allow admins to opt out any contact, even those not assigned to them.
- Fix send button alignment

## v5.0
_January 2020:_ Version 5.0
**Note:** This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change. See the deploy steps section for details.

This release includes the following improvements:

- Upgrades react-formal, which gets rid of browser-console warnings related to prop-types
- Fixes a bug for interaction step selection in safari
- Fixes a bug that was causing the people page to not allow you to edit users
- Adds smart color contrasting for the color picker in the campaign creation flow so that you can read the name of your campaign name no matter which color you make it
- Adds an option to allow sharing a single postgres database across multiple Spoke instances, but keep data separate, e.g. using `heroku addons:attach`
- Schema changes paving the way for scaling improvements
- Fixes editing files in emacs by avoiding using unicode
- Allows the Google Script Import feature to be deployed on AWS Lambda

Deploy Steps:

**Instructions for migrating large database instances (>1million messages/contacts)**

1. Make sure SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS=1 in your environment
2. Before deploying the code, you will want to do most of these changes (manually) beforehand, ideally while the system is down. If you are planning to do these migrations before deploying the new code, we strongly recommend merging [this PR separate from the schema changes](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/pull/1346) BEFORE these steps to your production instance. It removes a few bugs which caused postgres to deadlock on message table updates. Instructions below assume Postgres.

2.1 Create the additional columns:

```
ALTER TABLE message ADD COLUMN campaign_contact_id integer NULL REFERENCES campaign_contact(id);
ALTER TABLE message ADD COLUMN messageservice_sid text NULL;
ALTER TABLE message ALTER COLUMN assignment_id DROP NOT NULL;
```

These should be non-blocking and 'quick' -- i.e. downtime is probably unnecessary.

2.2 Once those complete, you will want to create the campaign_contact_id INDEX:

```
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY message_campaign_contact_id_index ON message (campaign_contact_id)
```

The CONCURRENTLY adverb should make this possible without downtime, but sometimes caution is best.

2.3 (LOCKING: Best with system unstressed/down) Next you want to start filling in the campaign_contact_id. You may want to prioritize live or recent campaigns with additional qualifications or do this in batches with a command similar to:

```
UPDATE message
SET campaign_contact_id = campaign_contact.id
FROM campaign_contact
WHERE message.assignment_id = campaign_contact.assignment_id
  AND message.contact_number = campaign_contact.cell
  AND message.id IN (
    SELECT id
    FROM message
    WHERE campaign_contact_id IS NULL
    LIMIT 1000000
  )
```

Note the "LIMIT 100000" is doing it in batches of 1 million. Another strategy would be to find the lowest campaign_contact_id value for your live campaigns and add a `WHERE campaign_contact.id > XXX` where XXX is that value (or do the same thing for message.id > XXX).

This WILL LOCK the MESSAGE table -- and thus stop processing of events, so you will want to do this off-hours, ideally with the system down.

Once you have done this with the majority of messages, especially messages for live campaigns, you should now be ready for _real_ downtime.

2.4 (LOCKING: _Requires_ downtime) The final step is to definitely take the system down if you haven't already. Complete updates to messageservice_sid and campaign_contact_id, there are some final steps:

```
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY cell_messageservice_sid_idx ON message (contact_number, messageservice_sid);
DROP INDEX message_contact_number_index;
INSERT INTO knex_migrations (name, batch, migration_time) VALUES
  ( '20191217125726_add_message_campaign_contact_id.js', 3, now()),
  ( '20191217130355_change_message_indexes.js', 3, now()),
  ('20191217130000_message_migrate_data.js', 3, now());
```

2.5 Deploy the new code!
2.6 As soon as possible (after system is working) then run:

```
DROP INDEX message_assignment_id_index;
```

NOTES:

- One of the main challenges besides migrating and indexing a large table is that many indexes on the `message` table with so many inserts, can tax the insertions too much and slow the system down. So, while we are indexing both assignment_id AND contact_number AND contact_number+messageservice_sid AND campaign_contact_id, the system is likely to be over stressed. This is why we stagger the index creation and then drop the unnecessary indexes as soon as we have the system up again. Obviously if ALL these steps are done during a single downtime, event, then that would work too -- but staggering them can allow shorter and stepped periods of downtime or migration.

## v4.1

_January 2019:_ Version 4.1

This release includes the following improvements:

- Fixes twilio bugs for incoming text spam and message duplicate tests
- Fixes bug in which Spoke was not scrubbing opt outs from larger organizations

Thanks to @schuyler1d and @strangeways for these critical fixes. This patch will be required in order to successfully update to v5.0

## v4.0

_December 2019:_ Version 4.0
**Note:** This is a major release and therefore requires a schema change. See the deploy steps section for details.

This release includes the following improvements:

- Adds better error logging to Spoke allowing visibility into errors that twilio and other messaging services are sending rather than them getting "lost"
- Fixes bulk send, which is used outside the USA to send more than one initial message with a single button click making it usable again!
- Multiple documentation fixes including better documentation on how to run the test suite
- Adds 2 React component tests
- Fixes bugs that wouldn't let you exit out of adding a new script, that made reassigning contacts often not work, that would often cause the skip reply button not to appear
- Updates the google-libphonenumber library to allow phone numbers using newer area codes (e.g. 463) to be validated.

Deploy Steps:

- Warning: This migration removes the `message.service_response` column which tracks responses to/from the Twilio API.
  This data is not needed for the application to function, but e.g. some users have queried it to keep the MediaUrl values
  (i.e. images sent to the texter, even though they aren't displayed). After the migration, they will still be queryable for
  new texts (only POST-migration texts) in the `log` table. If you're not sure, then before deploying, make sure you backup
  the `message` table--at least the `message.service_response` column.
- For the speediest migration, we recommend DELETING all past log rows with `TRUNCATE TABLE LOG`.
  Before doing so, consider backing up the `log` table -- though no data there is needed for running the application (and it takes up considerable space).
- For smaller instances (less than 1 million texts/contacts), the migration should complete automatically.
- For larger instances, it's better to enable the environment variable `SUPPRESS_MIGRATIONS=1`
  and then follow the relevant steps of your platform to upgrade ( [Heroku](./HOWTO_HEROKU_DEPLOY.md#migrating-the-database), [AWS Lambda](./DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md#migrating-the-database) )

_April 2019:_ Version 2.0.0

This release includes an improvement to message sending speeds, many usability improvements to the Admin Message Review panel, bug fixes for different features, improved data warehouse querying for audiences, Docker support/documentation, Local Authentication, etc. We also have switched to using `yarn` dev and install commands versus `npm`. To see an updated feature list, please visit opensource.moveon.org/spoke.

Migrations:

- Texting hour related columns to the `Campaign` table.
- Send_before column to the `Message` table.
- Creator_id column to the `Campaign` table.

Heroku:

The Heroku deployment method has been migrated to the container runtime. When upgrading an existing Heroku app, these [migration steps](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/33e2edcc455836f36eafd56d585430ac1ceda515/docs/HOWTO_HEROKU_DEPLOY.md#upgrading-an-existing-heroku-app) will need to be performed.

Lambda:

This version includes an update for the Node runtime environment. For current AWS Lambda Users - you can update your Node runtime to 8.10 by either visiting the `Function code` Section and moving the drop down to 8.10 or by running the following script: `claudia update --runtime nodejs8.10`. For new Lambda deployments, Claudia.js will default to Node 8.10.

## v1.4.1

_August 2018:_ Version 1.4.1

- This version fixes bugs found in 1.4 including a deployment bug.

## v1.4

This release includes many optimizations, new features and more tests! We've fixed outstanding bugs, added more administrative functionality and worked on the texter experience. We've also introduced a new testing suite and redis caching capabilities. Over the next couple months, we intend to add more testing and continue to work on scaling.

Note - we will have a new release in the next few weeks and switch to a shorter release cycle in the next few months. Please upgrade your instance and let us know if you find any bugs or have questions!

_July 2018:_ Version 1.4

- A 'Skipped Messages' section for texters to allow access to previously skipped conversations. Skipped conversations can be 'reopened' and filter back into the 'replies' view.
- A 'Message Review' board for administrators to allow message reassignment to different texters. Administrators also have the ability to see more incoming messages than previous.
- The ability to mark contacts as opted out without sending a message.
- Selenium end to end testing with Sauce Labs integration.
- Redis caching capabilities including caching user's authentication status.
- Updates to documentation for AK integration, popular queries, and email and data exporting integration.
- Bug fixes around owner, admin and superadmin permissions when attempting to text, timezone handling, permission issues on admin dashboard.

## v1.3

Two major themes that we are focusing on this year are improving
integrations and scaling. This release begins that work with support
for MailGun notifications and Revere subscriptions. In order to scale
work-flows, we have added a new SuperVolunteer position and now allow
texters to update their own information.

Over the next couple months, we intend to integrate with more outside
systems and we will also be adding significant work
around scaling the system to support much larger volumes and participants.
We will also be continuing to add more automated tests to scale participation.
All of that is to make sure that the growing community can keep adding
enhancements yourself -- please jump in on our issues page to either
implement something or file an issue on something you want Spoke to do!

Please upgrade your instance and let us know if you encounter any issues!

_April 2018:_ Version 1.3

- A 'Past Messages' section for Texters to allow access to previous conversations before a reply comes back.
  This feature helps cases where someone accidentally clicked a button or wants to follow-up with requested information.
- Texters can update their name, email and other information from the menu.
  Admins can update texter info from the console
- A new SuperVolunteer role, which allows a non-admin to update assignments, and [some other tasks](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues/455)
- Added [MailGun support](HOWTO_HEROKU_DEPLOY.md#setting-up-mailgun)
- Frontend React tests!
- Added an action handler to automatically subscribe to a [Revere](https://reverehq.com/)
  SMS list -- see [Revere integration instructions](HOWTO_INTEGRATE_WITH_REVERE.md)
- Fixed some bugs:
  - The texter menu now has a home button
  - The zipcode table was too big to fit in a free Heroku database
  - Some login issues were fixed and documentation was improved
  - Improved contact load times for texter screen

## v1.2

_January 2018:_ Version 1.2 is our second release since MoveOn has adopted Spoke. We are committed to fixing bugs, adding new features and making this project as nimble as possible. For this release, we've included changes from [GetUp](https://www.getup.org.au/), updated certain dependencies, updated Auth0 integration, added user editing capabilities for texters and admins and continued to add outside integration points with outside CRMs. Please continue to add and work on our growing [issues list](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues). We have also switched from `master` => `main` as a new naming convention for the most stable/default branch.

We've worked on a lot, but some critical developments to highlight include:

- Adds dynamic assignment functionality for texters
- Adds user editing capabilities for texters and administrators
- Adds support for customized styling for campaigns
- Adds ActionKit integration for event sign up and documentation
- Adds support for multi-media images in outgoing texts (mms)
- Adds support for campaign script editing on live campaigns
- Moved to Prop-Types library, upgraded Webpack and other development dependencies
- Adds Code Climate test integration to monitor test coverage
- Adds opt out count for a campaign to admin dashboard stats
- Adds free Heroku deployment setup
- Adds more automated tests

## v1.1

_October 2017:_ Version 1.1 is our first release since MoveOn has been using Spoke successfully in production. We are committed to
making this an open-source project used and developed by the wider progressive tech community to advance our
political goals. Part of our work has been to make that transparent. Besides this public repository, please help
with our growing [issues list](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/issues), including those marked `easy`.

But of course, we've also done some actual development work! We've fixed a ton of bugs, but here are some
highlights for this release:

- Adds a passing test framework
- Resolves many bugs related to saving and updating a Campaign for admins
- Improves the Texter interface (better reply visibility, especially on mobile) along with sending on `<Enter>`
- Adds a [Deploy to Heroku](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke#deploy-to-heroku) button for easier first-time deployments
- Documented [how to deploy on Amazon AWS Lambda](DEPLOYING_AWS_LAMBDA.md)
