# How to Integrate with CiviCRM

## Introduction

CiviCRM is a web-based, highly customizable CRM released under the GNU AGPL v3 license. It is used by a diverse range of organizations around the world.

## Available integrations

### Contact Loader

Load contacts from CiviCRM groups directly into a Spoke campaign. The loader retrieves the following data by default:

- CiviCRM contact ID
- first name
- last name
- zip/post code
- mobile phone

The loader can be configured to import additional fields through the use of Spoke environment variables (see below).

### Action Handlers

Add to Group - add a contact to a specified CiviCRM group from within a Spoke conversation
Add tag to Contact - add a tag to a contact in CiviCRM from within a Spoke conversation
Register for Event - register a person for an event in CiviCRM
Send email - send a person an email using a CiviCRM message template

These handlers require the CiviCRM contact loader be configured and available for use.

Additionally, the "Send email" action handler requires your CiviCRM installation has the [E-Mail API extension](https://civicrm.org/extensions/e-mail-api) installed and enabled.

### Service Manager

Do not SMS - whenever a contact is opted out in Spoke, the contact's record in CiviCRM will have the "do not SMS" flag enabled.

## Instructions

### Step One - creating an API key for CiviCRM

Integration with CiviCRM requires the creation of an API key, bound to a specific contact record or user account in CiviCRM, with suitable permissions.
The [CiviCRM System Administration guide](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/setup/api-keys/) includes instructions on how to create an API key.

### Step Two - making sure your variables are set in your production/development deployment environment

Modify your Spoke .env file to include the following environment variables:

- CONTACT_LOADERS - add `civicrm` to the comma-separated list
- CIVICRM_API_URL - should be the full URL of the [CiviCRM REST API](https://docs.civicrm.org/dev/en/latest/api/v3/rest/)
  (eg. <https://example.com/sites/all/modules/civicrm/extern/rest.php>)
- CIVICRM_API_KEY - the key you generated in step one
- CIVICRM_SITE_KEY - the site key for your CiviCRM installation. Defined in your `civicrm.settings.php` file ([more info](https://docs.civicrm.org/sysadmin/en/latest/setup/secret-keys/)).
- ACTION_HANDLERS - add `civicrm-addtogroup`, `civicrm-addtag`, `civicrm-registerevent` and `civicrm-sendemail` to enable the particular handlers of interest
- SERVICE_MANAGERS - add `civicrm-donotsms` to the comma-separated list

## Optional contact loader configuration

The CiviCRM contact loader offers two optional customizations to support additional requirements you may have.

### Additional custom data

The environment variable `CIVICRM_CUSTOM_DATA` can be used to specify additional data fields you wish to retrieve from CiviCRM.

By default, these attributes must be directly "attached" to a person's Contact record in CiviCRM and retrievable via CiviCRM's API interface when making a `Contact.get` API call.

Some examples include:

- `birth_date`
- `formal_title`
- `nick_name`

Simply declare the variable `CIVICRM_CUSTOM_DATA` and ensure it contains a comma-separated list of field names (without spaces).

Custom fields you may have created for Contact records in CiviCRM are also retrievable. CiviCRM's API references those fields using the `custom_xxx` syntax.
To make these fields human-readable (especially useful when used as tokens), you can define a label for them in the environment variable.

For example:
`CIVICRM_CUSTOM_DATA=custom_203:congressionalDistrict,custom_204:congressionalRep,middle_name,birth_date`

### Custom API call

In more complex cases, data you wish to retrieve may not be "attached" to Contact records in CiviCRM. An example might be data attached to a related entity such as a membership record.

One way of solving this problem is to create a CiviCRM extension that defines a new API action for the Contact entity that compiles all the desired data and returns it to Spoke.

In such a scenario, you can then use the `CIVICRM_CUSTOM_CONTACT_ACTION` variable in your Spoke installation to tell the CiviCRM contact loader to query CiviCRM's API via this action instead of the default `Contact.get`.

For example:
`CIVICRM_CUSTOM_CONTACT_ACTION=getforspoke` would generate a `Contact.getforspoke` request to the CiviCRM API.

## Action Handler configuration

The "Add to Group", "Add tag to Contact" and "Register for Event" handlers require no configuration. The first two will retrieve all groups and tags in your CiviCRM installation.
If you have a very large number of groups or tags this can cause delays in the Spoke UI.

The "Register for Event" handler will only retrieve CiviCRM events that:
- have no monetary component (ie. don't require payment)
- do not require approval
- have a future end date

The "Send email" handler requires the variable `CIVICRM_MESSAGE_IDS` be present in your .env file. It should contain a comma-separated list of CiviCRM message template IDs (without spaces).
This gives you control over which email templates you want to be available within Spoke.

## Caching

If you choose to use caching with CiviCRM, all data is cached by default for 1 hour (3600 seconds).
However, this can be changed by adding a `CIVICRM_CACHE_LENGTHS` environmental variable to your
`.env` file. This allows you to set individual cache lengths for the `civicrm` contact loader and
all CiviCRM action handlers on one line, but only for the loader and/or handlers you choose. This
uses the same "comma-separated list of entity names (without spaces)" syntax as used for the
`CIVICRM_CUSTOM_CONTACT_ACTION` variable; the values after the colons are lengths in seconds.
Any contact loader or action handlers not listed default to 1 hour of cache time. An example of this
is:

```
CIVICRM_CACHE_LENGTHS=civicrm:7200,civicrm-registerevent:0,civicrm-sendemail:1800
```

This tells Spoke that:

- The `civicrm` contact loader should cache for 7200 seconds (2 hours).
- The `civicrm-registerevent` action handler should cache for 0 seconds (i.e, no caching).
- The `civicrm-sendemail` action handler should cache for 1800 seconds (30 minutes).
- The other action handlers (`civicrm-addtogroup` and `civicrm-addtag`) cache for the default hour.

Of course, caching has to be turned on for these values to be of effect.
