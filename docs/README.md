# Spoke Documentation Hub

Welcome to the Spoke documentation hub! This is the documentation micro-site for [Spoke's docs folder](https://github.com/StateVoicesNational/Spoke/tree/main/docs) to make the docs more readable and user-friendly.

Spoke is an open source text-distribution tool for organizations to mobilize supporters and members into action. Spoke allows you to upload phone numbers, customize scripts and assign volunteers to communicate with supporters while allowing organizations to manage the process.

## How to contribute to the Spoke docs
[Any issues tagged with the C-documentation tag](https://github.com/StateVoicesNational/Spoke/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AC-documentation) are feature requests for docs that we'd love for you to add! We also have a sidebar section that reads "Outlines of docs we wish we had - contributors welcome!" that we'd love for folks to flesh out.

You can add a doc by making a pull request to [Spoke's repo](https://github.com/StateVoicesNational/Spoke) with changes to the doc. If you're adding a new doc, please add it to the [sidebar.md file](_sidebar.md) to make sure it shows up in the doc table of contents.

We also accept PRs that want to reorder docs in the table of contents to help with readability!
