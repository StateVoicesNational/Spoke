# How to Buy Numbers in Twilio

This guide assumes you already have twilio set up with Spoke. If you don't, check out our guide on [integrating Twilio](HOWTO_INTEGRATE_TWILIO.md).

If you are comfortable using the Linux command line, and/or will be buying many numbers across many area codes, you should take a look at the [switchboard-twilio tool](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/switchboard-twilio) which is here to help you buy in higher quantities.

1. Go to the “Programmable SMS Dashboard” in Twilio

7. Search by area code to find numbers
8. Click the buy button when you're ready to buy the number. - You should see: "The number has been associated with this messaging service" in the modal when you buy a number. That is the indicator that the number is being linked to Spoke.
