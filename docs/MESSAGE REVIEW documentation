What Is 'Message Review'?

How Do I Use Message Review?

Tips and Tricks

'Refresh Filters' for Message Review: In Message Review, say you are doing 'power reassigning' of all Needs Texter Response to yourself, or another user. Here's what I do. First, select the Campaign and Needs Texter Response, and Reassign to [user]. Select Enter. You'll see any Needs Texter Response, and can reassign those. Leave that window open. Go back in a few minutes, and in Contact message status, select *both* All and Needs Texter Response. With the drop down still open in Contact message status, *unselect* All. You'll see new Needs Texter Response since you last ran that. Select all the new Needs Texter Response using the checkbox at top and Reassign to [user].
