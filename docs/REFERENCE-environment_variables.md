| DEBUG_SCALING                                    | Emit console.log on events related to scaling issues. _Default_: false.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| DEFAULT_TZ                                      | Default timezone region for determining timezone when a contact timezone is unavailable. If this is not set, then texting hours will fallback to 12pm Eastern to 9pm Eastern which is the most conservative value for texting hours in the continental US and probably the right default. Only set this if your entire audience is in a single timezone.                                                                                                                                            |

| DEV_APP_PORT                                     | Port for development Webpack server. Required for development.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| DOWNTIME                                     | When enabled it will redirect users to a /downtime page.  If set to a string, it will show the string as a message to users on the downtime page.  Use this to take the system down for maintenance.  It will NOT stop graphql requests and will NOT stop users that are already in the app. |
| DOWNTIME_NO_DB                               | On AWS Lambda this blocks the site from loading the app at all and swaps out a system that redirects users to /downtime.  This is useful for DB maintenance.  For non-Lambda environments, just run the src/server/downtime app instead of src/server/index default app    |
| DOWNTIME_TEXTER                              | Setting DOWNTIME_TEXTER to a text message (without quotes, please) will give the message as a text to texters when they arrive on the site, but the admin pages will still be accessible.  This could be useful if you want to stop new texters from landing on the site and texting, while you debug things. |
| DST_REFERENCE_TIMEZONE                           | Timezone to use to determine whether DST is in effect. If it's DST in this timezone, we assume it's DST everywhere. _Default_: "US/Eastern". (The default will work for any campaign in the US. For example, if the campaign is in Australia, use "Australia/Sydney" or some other timezone in Australia. Note that DST is opposite in the northern and souther hemispheres.)         |
| CONTACT_LOADERS                                       | Optional contact loaders in [extensions/contact-loaders](https://github.com/StateVoicesNational/Spoke/tree/main/src/extensions/contact-loaders) _`ngpvan` Required for VAN integration_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

For emails providers such as Postmark that use STARTTLS, set to `0` to connect with STARTTLS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| EXPERIMENTAL_TWILIO_PER_CAMPAIGN_MESSAGING_SERVICE            | Allow campaigns to have their own messaging service. This allows Spoke to send more than default Twilio limits of 400 numbers or 80,000 texts per day |
| EXPERIMENTAL_CAMPAIGN_PHONE_NUMBERS              | Allows campaigns to select numbers from the inventory by area code. Currently only implemented for Twilio and fakeservice. When using Twilio, this creates a messaging service for each campaign on the fly. Requires PHONE_INVENTORY to be turned on.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| EXPERIMENTAL_STICKY_SENDER                       | Creates permanent mappings between contact numbers and user numbers per organization when a recipient is texted. Once the mapping exists, that contact number will always be texted by that user number. This also means that messaging services will be skipped in favor of the direct user number.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| FIX_ORGLESS                                      | Set to any truthy value only if you want to run the job that automatically assigns the default org (see DEFAULT_ORG) to new users who have no assigned org.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| GRAPHQL_URL                                      | Optional URL for pointing GraphQL API requests. Should end with `/graphql`, e.g. `https://example.org/graphql`. _Default_: "/graphql"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| HIDE_BRANCHED_SCRIPTS                                      | Convert UI to only used canned responses and hide all the interactions/questions. In the interactions section, specify an "Initial Outbound" message, then include canned responses. This also filters shortcut canned responses by the typed message text and shortens canned response titles rather than hiding their shortcut buttons when they are too long.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| JOBS_SAME_PROCESS                                | Boolean value indicating whether jobs should be executed in the same process in which they are created (vs. processing asyncronously via worker processes). _Default_: false.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| NGP_VAN_API_KEY                                  | API key. Generate an API key on the [API Integrations section of VAN](https://everyaction.readme.io/docs/key-generation-and-usage#how-do-i-get-a-production-client-api-key). Select `Spoke` or `Spoke Basic` API key type. Depending on a user's permission level the key may be generated automatically or need to be approved by their admin (users should contact their organization's VAN admin to request additional permissions as needed). `Spoke Basic` only supports writing data back into VAN, it does not have access to Export Jobs, while `Spoke` can export. Most users will only see `Spoke` but VAN clients who do not allow exports via API can request to have `Spoke Basic` added. _Required_ for VAN integration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
