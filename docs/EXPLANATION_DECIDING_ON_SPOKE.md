# Deciding to use Spoke

You should treat all tech infrastructure choices as 'build vs buy' decisions, and make the right choice for your organization.

## Reasons to run Spoke:
1. You want to run a peer-to-peer textbanking system at scale and pay only infrastructure costs
1. You have the tech capacity to do the technical deployment work to set up Spoke and maintain your instance over time. 
1. You want to be able to control costs and system scaling on your own terms. Perhaps you have experienced scaling problems from a textbanking vendor at an inopportune time. You can choose to control this risk by spending developer time and money on hardware running your own system.
1. You care about the open source community, want to give back to the progressive movement, and are interested in contributing back fixes and features.
1. You don't want to sign a contract with a vendor, and may have a more short term need for peer to peer texting.

## Reasons to not run Spoke:
1. You have straightforward and non-bursty scaling needs that are well documented, that a vendor can meet for you. (We recommend contractually binding vendors to SLAs that ensure you get the service you have been promised)
1. You have more money than developer time to spend. 
1. You don't have an organizational need to control costs, system scaling, or vendor risk.
