# Labels and how we use them

We've loosely based our labeling system off of [Rust's conventions for prefixing labels](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/labels). Labels are a big part of the issue intake process to help us figure out how the submission fits into the project. We have a few different prefixes that we use to help distinguish the categories of labels:

### Area (`A-`)
For marking different sections of the codebase or different pages in the product. They are helpful for sorting issues by your familiarity with a part of Spoke.

### Category (`C-`)
For marking the "type" of issue this is. For example, this is used to differentiate between bugs and features.

### Status (`S-`)
For marking the status of pull requests. These are used by core contributors and admin during the review process to communicate to each other what state a PR is in.

### Organization (`O-`)
For marking the priorities of specific orgs that are part of the community. Filter by these labels to engage more directly with orgs.
