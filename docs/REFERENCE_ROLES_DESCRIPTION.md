Previously roles on Spoke included 'Admin', 'Texter', and 'Owner'. We currently want to shift application permissions to reflect the following user stories. As of August 2018, the roles work as following:

1) Organization Administrator - This user can view all campaigns and have access to upload contacts, create campaigns, organizations and download reports
2) Campaign Admin - This user (super texter/trusted volunteer) has the ability to create a campaign and be over individual campaigns assigned to them (by org admin)
3) Super Volunteer - This user, designated by a campaign administrator, has the ability to edit campaigns in the following ways:
    * Edit/update campaign basics (ie title, due date). This user does not have access to campaign contact data (ex: uploading capabilities, exporting capabilities) and cannot create or copy campaigns.
    * Assign texters to a campaigns.
    * Edit the interaction script.
    * Create canned responses for a campaign.
4) Texter - This user can only see their todos for their assigned campaigns
5) Suspended - This user should have no access
