# Spoke

Spoke is an open source text-distribution tool for organizations to mobilize supporters and members into action. Spoke allows you to upload phone numbers, customize scripts and assign volunteers to communicate with supporters while allowing organizations to manage the process.

Spoke was created by Saikat Chakrabarti and Sheena Pakanati, and is now maintained by MoveOn.org.

The latest version is [8.0](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/tree/v8.0) (see [release notes](https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/blob/main/docs/RELEASE_NOTES.md#v80))




## Get Started


The easiest way to get started is with Heroku.  You can also learn about Spoke through the [texter](https://youtu.be/EqE1UDvKGco) and [admin](https://youtu.be/PTMykMX8gII) video demos or in the explanation on [how to decide if Spoke is right for you.](/docs/EXPLANATION_DECIDING_ON_SPOKE.md)

For developers, please see our recomendations for [deploying locally for development](/docs/HOWTO_DEVELOPMENT_LOCAL_SETUP.md).



## Quick Start with Heroku
This version of Spoke suitable for testing and, potentially, for small campaigns. This won't cost any money and will not support production usage. It's a great way to practice deploying Spoke or see it in action.  

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/tree/v8.0">

</a>

Follow up instructions located [here](/docs/HOWTO_HEROKU_DEPLOY.md).


**NOTE:** You can upgrade this deployment later for use in a production (aka large-scale) setting, but keep in mind you will lose the data from any prior campaigns.  Thus it is best to upgrade before you start any live campaigns.  This will cost $75 ($25 dyno + $50 postgres) a month and should be suitable for production level usage for most organizations. Alternatively, you can click [this link to deploy with a production infrastructure from the start!](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/MoveOnOrg/Spoke/tree/heroku-button-paid)
